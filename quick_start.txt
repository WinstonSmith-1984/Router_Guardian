To get **Router Guardian** actually seeing traffic, you need to tell your router to act as the data source. This is usually called "Remote Syslog" or "Log Forwarding."

### 📡 Router Configuration Guide

Adding this section to your **README** will help users get the tool running:

1. **Identify your Host IP**: Find the local IP address of the computer running `router_guardian.py` (e.g., `192.168.50.15`).
2. **Access Router Settings**: Log into your router’s web interface (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.50.1`).
3. **Find Log Settings**: Look for a menu labeled **System Log**, **Administration**, or **Status**.
4. **Enable Remote Logging**:
* **Remote Log Server**: Enter your computer's IP address.
* **Port**: Enter `1514` (as defined in your code).


5. **Save & Apply**: Once saved, the router will begin broadcasting UDP packets that the script’s `syslog_listener` will intercept.

### 📋 Example README Section: Quick Start

```markdown
## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Environment
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Configure Your Router

Go to your router's **Admin/Syslog** settings and point the **Remote Syslog Server** to your computer's IP on port `1514`.

### 3. Launch the Guardian

```bash
streamlit run router_guardian.py

```

### 4. Verify Connection

Look for the `🖧 PULSE: Heartbeat received` message in the **Live Event Stream** at the bottom of the dashboard.

### 🛡️ Why Port 1514?
Your script is specifically bound to `SYSLOG_PORT = 1514`. Standard Syslog often uses port `514`, but using `1514` is a common practice to avoid needing "Administrator/Root" privileges on many operating systems to open the port.
